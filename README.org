#+TITLE: Visèd

Structural editor and residential programming environment for interactive
graphics.

N.B.: This is an early stage thought experiment so don't assume I know what I'm
talking about.

* Overview

	[[https://github.com/tgetgood/falloleen][Falloleen]] is my latest attempt at a declarative data description for
	graphics. It has a lot of flaws, but the biggest is the fact that text is just
	a terrible medium in which to talk about graphics.

	This visual editor is an attempt to address that problem. I guarantee you that
	will expose new problems in the graphics language itself, but that's a good
	thing.
